INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD IML LOGO:

1. Save the blue IML circular seal/emblem logo (the one with three crowns and text)
2. Name it: iml-seal-logo.png
3. Save to: C:\Users\chrwah28.KVA\Development\imlseminars\public\images\

Then I will update the code to use it.

The logo should be the official circular blue IML seal that shows:
- "KUNGL. VETENSKAPSAKADEMIEN" around the edge
- Three crowns symbol
- Circular blue design
